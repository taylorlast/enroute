## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- `StreamChunk.to_openai()` so a hosted gateway can emit one OpenAI Chat Completions
  SSE shape from every host. `raw` stays on the chunk for debugging and is not
  part of the client contract.
- Live stream smoke tests that pin `provider.only` for each configured key.

### Fixed

- Anthropic streams now carry `input_tokens` from `message_start` onto the usage
  chunk, so a streamed prompt is billed at the real token count.
- OpenAI-compatible hosts that 400 on `stream_options` are retried without it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Initial `enroute` package: unified LLM routing with traces, environments, and benchmarks.
- Native httpx providers for OpenAI-compatible APIs, Anthropic, and Google.
- `Enroute` client with hosted-gateway mode (`ENROUTE_API_KEY`) and BYOK `providers={...}`.
- Routing policies, fallbacks, retries, model catalog, and local cost estimation.
- Tracing with JSONL/SQLite/OTel sinks, redaction, sampling, and late labels.
- Environments (tasks, tools, scorers), versioned datasets, and benchmark reports.
- Docs site (MkDocs) and cookbook-style routing examples.
